Introduction
You are implementing search/filter functionalities for an online shop application for your client. A colleague of yours has already implemented some of the functionalities requested by the client, but he is currently on holidays. You have to help finish the remaining functionalities, so the team meets the deadline.

The missing functionalities include:

Checkbox fields that allow users to display or hide specific columns in the table of products.
Filter fields that allow users to set a range on the items prices.
If the user provides only the starting price, the product price should be inside the [startPrice, infinity] interval. However, if the user provides the ending price only, the interval should be [0, endPrice]. Also, when passing the same price at both ends [price, price], products of this exact price should get filtered.
Users should be able to see the filtered or searched products in a table.
Setup
This react application was generated using Create React App. It has all the standard setups.

Follow these steps if you are using zip/git mode (i.e. not available inside Devskiller in-browser IDE):

npm install – install dependencies
npm test – run all tests (this will be used to evaluate your solutions)
npm start – run the project locally
Problem Statement
Your task is to:

Make sure to products are imported from the products.json inside /src/assets/ folder, which will be used for the search/filter functionalities.
Put the imported data in the products array in the Search component.
Implement the toggle functionality by adding a handler to the checkbox change in the ToggleColumns component.
Pass a column object to the ProductList and reflect the change in the checkbox appropriately (by displaying or hiding the column).
Pass the filtered products to the ProductList component, so they get displayed in the table.
Show each item from the passed prop in the table inside the ProductList component.
Pass the priceFrom and the priceTo attributes to the FilterForm component as props.
Implement the change input and submit the form handlers to the FilterForm component.
Change the filtered products that are displayed in the ProductList, so that it only contains the products with a price within the specified range.
Note that you're not allowed to change names or signatures of functions passed to components as properties.

For more details, please run the task on the Devskiller platform and see the failing tests.

Make sure that all tests pass.
